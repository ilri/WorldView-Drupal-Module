WorldView is a Drupal 7.x module developed in 2011 by Martin Norling of the 
International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi Kenya. 

The module plots data on Google Earth (if available) or Google Maps. The 
current implementation depends on the DataGrabber module which extracts data 
from databases at ILRI and plots them on the map. As a stand-alone module the 
use is limited but it can easily be used as a base to generate KML and plot on 
Google Earth/Google Maps.
